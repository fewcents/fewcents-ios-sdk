# MoEngage-iOS-SDK

Fewcents enables small payments for the creator economy. We allow digital publishers to unbundle and micro-monetize text, audio, or video formats in 50+ currencies.


## Manual Integration

### 1. Download SDK
The first step in integrating with your app is to [download the iOS SDK](https://github.com/fewcents/fewcents-ios-sdk/blob/main/Frameworks/Fewcents-iOS-SDK.xcframework.zip) itself.

### 2. Add the SDK to Your Project
After unzipping the SDK, you find `Fewcents-iOS-SDK.xcframework`. Then, click on the main `FewcentsSwiftSample` project file in Xcode. Select the `app` target and the `General` tab. Scroll down to the `Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded Content` section and drag and drop the `Fewcents-iOS-SDK.xcframework` into the section. Build the project. See the below image as reference.

Thatâ€™s it. The framework is added to our project.
