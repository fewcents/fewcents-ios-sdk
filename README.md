# MoEngage-iOS-SDK

Fewcents enables small payments for the creator economy. We allow digital publishers to unbundle and micro-monetize text, audio, or video formats in 50+ currencies.


## Manual Integration

### 1. Download SDK
The first step in integrating with your app is to [download the iOS SDK](https://github.com/fewcents/fewcents-ios-sdk/blob/main/Frameworks/Fewcents-iOS-SDK.xcframework.zip) itself.

### 2. Add the SDK to Your Project
After unzipping the SDK, you find `Fewcents-iOS-SDK.xcframework`. Then, click on the main `FewcentsSwiftSample` project file in Xcode. Select the `app` target and the `General` tab. Scroll down to the `Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded Content` section and drag and drop the `Fewcents-iOS-SDK.xcframework` into the section. See the below image as reference.

Build the project. 
Thatâ€™s it. The framework is added to our project.


### Fewcents SDK Initialization

  In your `ViewController` file import the `Fewcents-iOS-SDK` 

#### Swift
---- 
 ```objc
 #import Fewcents-iOS-SDK
 ```
 
 Add the following in `ViewDidLoad` method of `ViewController` to initialize the SDK
 
```objc
let fewcents = Fewcents(accessKey: ACCESS_KEY,
                        category: CATEGORY,
                        logoUrl: LOGO_URL,
                        articleUrl: ARTICLE_URL,
                        publisherCustomerId: PUBLISHER_CUSTOMER_ID,
                        publisherDomain: PUBLISHER_DOMAIN)
```

```
Where 
  ACCESS_KEY            : created when publisher registers in the system and to be shared by fc team over email
  CATEGORY              : article category - to be populated by client
  LOGO_URL              : to be populated by client
  PUBLISHER_CUSTOMER_ID : client customer id (optional)
  PUBLISHER_DOMAIN.     : domain of the publisher
``` 
 
Finally, the SDK is successfully integrated and initialized in the project, and ready to use.


### Usage

#### Swift
----
```
//load default behaviour

or

```

```
Where 
  in            : ViewController of the contents
